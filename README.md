This project was created as a part of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ 'Udemy') course _React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)_ by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps 'Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Twitter').

By preparing this project I learned basics about Next.js.
